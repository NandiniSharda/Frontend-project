## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to use flexbox to style the QR code and also how to style the text in center.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus more on how to use flexbox effectively.
